# Emscripten

Emscripten is a complete compiler toolchain to WebAssembly using LLVM with a special focus on speed, size and Web platform.

## Porting

Compile your existing projects written in C, C++ or any language that uses LLVM to browsers, NodeJS or WebAssembly run-times.

## APIs

Emscripten converts OpenGL into WebGL and has support for familiar APIs like SDL, pthreads, POSIX as well as Web APIs and JavaScript.

## Fast

Thanks to the combination of LLVM, Emscripten, Binaryen and WebAssembly the output is compact and runs at near-native speed.
